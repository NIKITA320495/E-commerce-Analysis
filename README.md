# E-commerce Analysis Project

## Overview
This project provides an in-depth analysis of e-commerce data using Python, SQL, and Power BI. By utilizing advanced SQL queries for detailed analysis and creating an interactive Power BI dashboard, it uncovers valuable insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance. The project was inspired by the [Target Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/devarajv88/target-dataset?select=products.csv), which includes essential data about products, sales, and customer demographics.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Preparation**: Converted CSV files to SQL format, enabling efficient querying and data manipulation.
2. **Advanced SQL Queries**: Executed complex SQL queries to derive insights on e-commerce metrics such as top-selling products, customer purchasing patterns, and sales trends.
3. **Data Visualization**: Created a Power BI dashboard for an intuitive, interactive exploration of insights obtained from the data.

## Data Preparation
In the initial step, raw CSV files were converted into SQL tables for easier data handling. This process involved:
- Loading the data into SQL-compatible formats.
- Cleaning and transforming data to ensure consistency and accuracy in analysis.

## SQL Analysis
Advanced SQL queries provided insights into key business metrics:

1. **Top Products**: Identified bestsellers by revenue and quantity.
2. **Customer Segmentation**: Grouped customers by spending and frequency.
3. **Sales Trends**: Analyzed seasonal and annual sales patterns.
4. **Customer Retention**: Assessed retention rates and flagged churn risks.
5. **Regional Revenue**: Evaluated revenue by region for targeted growth.
6. **Discount Impact**: Measured discount effects on sales and profit.
7. **Shipping Timeliness**: Identified delivery bottlenecks.
8. **Product Returns**: Analyzed return rates to improve quality control.

## Power BI Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard provides a user-friendly, interactive experience, making it easy to:
- View key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics.
- Filter data by dimensions such as product category, time period, and region.
- Understand trends and patterns intuitively through visualizations.

The Power BI report file is included in the repository.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data cleaning and conversion of CSV files to SQL format.
- **SQL**: Advanced querying for in-depth data analysis.
- **Power BI**: For creating a dynamic dashboard to visualize the analysis results.

## Getting Started
To explore this project:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Use the SQL queries provided to recreate the insights in a SQL environment.
3. Open the Power BI report file to interact with the dashboard and explore insights.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a comprehensive data analysis workflow using SQL for advanced querying and Power BI for visualization. The insights derived can aid in making data-driven decisions, improving customer targeting, and optimizing product and inventory management.
