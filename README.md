# E-commerce Analysis Project

## Overview
This project provides an in-depth analysis of e-commerce data using Python, SQL, and Power BI. By leveraging advanced SQL queries and data visualization techniques, we derive valuable insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance. This project was inspired by the [Target Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/devarajv88/target-dataset?select=products.csv), which includes information on products, sales, and customer demographics.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Preparation**: Converted CSV files to SQL format for efficient querying and data manipulation.
2. **Advanced SQL Queries**: Wrote complex SQL queries to extract insights on key e-commerce metrics such as top-selling products, customer purchasing patterns, sales trends, and more.
3. **Data Visualization**: Created an interactive Power BI dashboard to visually explore and communicate insights derived from the data.

## Data Preparation
To begin, CSV files were loaded into SQL tables. This process involved:
- Converting raw CSV files to SQL-compatible format.
- Cleaning and transforming data to ensure accuracy and consistency in SQL queries.

## SQL Analysis
This project emphasizes advanced SQL querying techniques. Examples of insights derived from the data:
- **Top-Selling Products**: Identified products with the highest sales volumes.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Segmented customers based on purchasing behavior.
- **Sales Trends**: Analyzed seasonal trends and identified peak sales periods.
  
SQL code snippets for these queries can be found in the `SQL Queries` folder.

## Power BI Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard visualizes insights and allows users to interact with data, making it easier to:
- Explore key metrics and KPIs.
- Filter data by different dimensions (e.g., product category, time period).
- Gain an intuitive understanding of trends and patterns.

The Power BI report file is included in the repository.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Data cleaning and conversion of CSV files to SQL.
- **SQL**: Advanced querying for data analysis.
- **Power BI**: Dashboard creation for visualizing insights.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Load the provided SQL queries to recreate insights.
3. Open the Power BI report file to view the interactive dashboard.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a full data analysis workflow using SQL for querying and Power BI for visualization. The insights derived from the data highlight critical business aspects, enabling data-driven decision-making.
